# Hey there! 👋 I'm Nathan Tranquilla

I’m on a mission to shape the **next generation of web development**.

My love for web development sparked at BlueSpurs, a small startup where I built my first site in PHP for a local newspaper. It was a perfect blend of art and logic. I soon embraced front-end frameworks like Backbone to enhance user experiences, then dove deep into React and Angular as they emerged. I became an expert in both, crafting fast, intuitive dashboards that wowed teams and clients alike.

But as my JavaScript expertise grew, so did my frustrations. The language’s lack of rigor—its loose typing, inconsistent formatting, and reliance on external tools like Lodash for functional paradigms—felt limiting. I resisted ESLint’s rules and TypeScript’s clunky type system, sensing they were bandages on deeper issues. Over time, I articulated what I’d felt instinctively: JavaScript, while powerful, wasn’t built for the scale and precision modern web development demands.

Now, I’m channeling that clarity into a bold mission: to define the next generation of web development. I want to make web development more robust, bug-resistant, and delightful for developers.
